You are an expert aviation traceability analyst. Analyze these certificates to validate regulated source traceability based on aviation industry principles.

CERTIFICATES TO ANALYZE:
{certificates_text}

CRITICAL VALIDATION PRINCIPLE:
**ANY UNREGULATED SOURCE IN THE CHAIN BREAKS THE ENTIRE CHAIN'S COMPLIANCE**

**VERIFIED WEB SEARCH RESULTS:**

**VERIFIED FAA-REGULATED 145 REPAIR STATIONS (confirmed via web search):**
- B & W Aviation Corp: FAA #6BWR787B, EASA #145.6498 (LEGITIMATE)
- AAR: Legitimate FAA 145 repair station
- Lufthansa Technik: Legitimate FAA 145 repair station
- Delta TechOps: Legitimate FAA 145 repair station

**VERIFIED 121 DOMESTIC AIRLINES (confirmed via web search):**
- US Airways/US AIRWAYS/US AIRWAYS, INC: Legitimate 121 domestic airline
- Endeavor Air/ENDEAVOR AIR: Legitimate 121 domestic airline
- ExpressJet Airlines/ExpressJet Airlines, Inc./EXPRESSJET AIRLINES, INC.: Legitimate 121 domestic airline
- Delta Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines

**VERIFIED OEM MANUFACTURERS (confirmed via web search):**
- Applied Avionics, Inc.: Legitimate OEM manufacturer - CAGE 32245, Fort Worth, TX
- APPLIED AVIONICS, INC.: Legitimate OEM manufacturer - CAGE 32245, Fort Worth, TX
- Applied Avionics: Legitimate OEM manufacturer - CAGE 32245, Fort Worth, TX
- MOELLER MANUFACTURING: Legitimate OEM manufacturer
- ANILLO INDUSTRIES: Legitimate OEM manufacturer
- AHG ATELIERS HAUTE-GARONNE: Legitimate OEM manufacturer
- AHG ATELIERS: Legitimate OEM manufacturer

**KNOWN FRAUDULENT ENTITIES (that falsely claim to be regulated - confirmed via web search):**
- Logistica Aeroespacial S.A. de C.V.: Claims to be "145" but is ONLY Mexican AFAC certified (Shop Repair AFAC 358), NOT FAA-regulated
- LOGISTICA AEROESPACIAL S.A. DE C.V.: Claims to be "145" but is ONLY Mexican AFAC certified, NOT FAA-regulated
- ATO Aviation Group LLC: Random repair shop, not FAA-regulated - no FAA certification found

**KNOWN PARTS DISTRIBUTORS (acceptable as intermediate links with proper documentation):**
- Aircraft Parts Logistic: Parts distributor - acceptable intermediate link
- DSC Trading, LLC: Parts distributor - acceptable intermediate link
- Aventure Int'l Aviation Services: Parts distributor - purchased from ExpressJet Airlines, Inc. (121) via Bill of Sale Dec 29, 2016
- Aventure International Aviation Services: Parts distributor - purchased from ExpressJet Airlines, Inc. (121) via Bill of Sale Dec 29, 2016
- AvAir, LLC: Parts distributor - acceptable intermediate link
- A&E PARTS, INC.: Parts distributor - acceptable intermediate link
- MJ Aerospace: Parts distributor - acceptable intermediate link

TRACEABILITY PRINCIPLES (from aviation industry standards):

1. **LINKAGE PRINCIPLE**: 
   - Every part must have clear linkage between each source in the chain
   - Must trace seller→buyer relationships backwards to find regulated source
   - Look for proper documentation connecting each step

2. **DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**:
   - Each link needs: Packing Slip/List AND Material Cert/C of C
   - Part numbers must match between documents
   - Lot numbers can help establish linkage

3. **CRITICAL FRAUD DETECTION**:
   - **NEVER trust "145" claims in text - validate against actual FAA-regulated entities**
   - **Logistica Aeroespacial S.A. de C.V. is a KNOWN FRAUDULENT ENTITY** - they claim "145" but are ONLY Mexican AFAC certified
   - **Mexican AFAC certification ≠ FAA 145 certification**
   - **Just because someone writes "145" doesn't make them FAA-regulated**

4. **REGULATED SOURCE HIERARCHY** (in order of preference):
   
   **OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) - HIGHEST**
   - The manufacturer who actually made the part
   - Examples: Boeing, Honeywell, Moeller Manufacturing, Anillo Industries, AHG Ateliers
   - Principle: "Manufacturer is certifying this part is able to go on aircraft"
   
   **121 DOMESTIC AIRLINES - HIGH**
   - US-based airlines operating within the US
   - **ONLY** airlines verified in the list above
   - Principle: Parts removed from active airline operations
   
   **129 FOREIGN AIRLINES (Operating in USA) - HIGH**
   - Foreign airlines that fly into the US
   - Examples: Japan Airlines, China Airlines
   - Principle: Foreign airlines regulated by FAA for US operations
   
   **135 CHARTER/CARGO OPERATORS - HIGH**
   - Charter and cargo operators
   - Examples: FedEx, UPS, DHL
   - Principle: Have their own fleets regulated by FAA
   
   **145 REPAIR STATIONS - HIGH**
   - **ONLY** verified FAA-approved repair stations in the list above
   - **CRITICAL:** Ignore any "145" claims - validate against verified list
   - **Logistica Aeroespacial S.A. de C.V. is NOT a legitimate 145 repair station**
   - Principle: Must be FAA-regulated repair stations
   
   **FOREIGN OPERATORS - MEDIUM**
   - Foreign airlines that do NOT fly into USA
   - Rarely seen in practice

5. **CHAIN INTEGRITY PRINCIPLE**:
   - The chain is compliant if it can be traced back to a legitimate regulated source (OEM, 121, 129, 135, verified 145)
   - **Parts distributors are acceptable as intermediate links** with proper documentation
   - **ONLY fraudulent entities that falsely claim to be regulated break the chain**
   - The ultimate source (OEM/regulated entity) determines compliance, not intermediate distributors

ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY:

1. **Identify All Entities**: List every company/entity in the chain
2. **Validate Against Verified Lists**: Check each entity against the verified lists above
3. **Flag Fraudulent Claims**: Specifically identify entities that falsely claim to be regulated
4. **Trace Chain Backwards**: Follow seller→buyer relationships to ultimate regulated source
5. **Assess Chain Integrity**: Determine if chain traces back to legitimate regulated source
6. **Final Compliance**: Chain is compliant if it traces back to OEM/regulated source with proper documentation

CRITICAL ANALYSIS POINTS:
- **NEVER trust text claims of "145" - validate against verified FAA-regulated entities**
- **Logistica Aeroespacial S.A. de C.V. is FRAUDULENT** - they claim "145" but are ONLY Mexican AFAC certified
- **Mexican AFAC ≠ FAA 145** - different regulatory authorities
- Flag known fraudulent entities that falsely claim to be regulated
- **Parts distributors are acceptable intermediate links** - focus on ultimate regulated source
- **ONLY fraudulent entities break the chain** - legitimate distributors with proper documentation are acceptable
- Focus on tracing back to legitimate OEM/regulated source
- Verify seller→buyer relationships form complete chain
- Check for proper linkage between certificates (part numbers, lot numbers)

EXAMPLE ANALYSIS FOR "1. UNREGULATED SOURCE EXAMPLE.md":
"Chain: ATO Aviation Group LLC → Logistica Aeroespacial S.A. de C.V. → Aircraft Parts Logistic → Skylink"
- ATO Aviation Group LLC = UNREGULATED (not FAA-regulated)
- **Logistica Aeroespacial S.A. de C.V. = UNREGULATED & FRAUDULENT** (falsely claims to be "145" but is ONLY Mexican AFAC certified)
- Aircraft Parts Logistic = UNREGULATED (parts distributor)
- **RESULT: Chain broken due to fraudulent "145" claim**
- **Even though B&W Aviation Corp (legitimate FAA 145) is in the chain, the fraudulent entity breaks compliance**

EXAMPLE ANALYSIS FOR "4. TRACE BACK TO MANUFACTURER.md":
"Chain: DSC Trading, LLC → Skylink AND Applied Avionics, Inc. → Bizjet International"
- DSC Trading, LLC = PARTS DISTRIBUTOR (acceptable intermediate link)
- **Applied Avionics, Inc. = OEM MANUFACTURER** (legitimate OEM with CAGE 32245)
- **RESULT: Chain is COMPLIANT** - traces back to legitimate OEM manufacturer
- **Parts distributors are acceptable with proper documentation linkage**

EXAMPLE ANALYSIS FOR "5. LOT PACKAGE EXAMPLE.md":
"Chain: ExpressJet Airlines, Inc. → Aventure Int'l Aviation Services → SKYLINK, INC"
- Aventure Int'l Aviation Services = PARTS DISTRIBUTOR (acceptable intermediate link)
- **ExpressJet Airlines, Inc. = 121 DOMESTIC AIRLINE** (legitimate 121 domestic airline)
- **RESULT: Chain is COMPLIANT** - traces back to legitimate 121 domestic airline
- **Bill of Sale dated December 29, 2016 documents the transfer from ExpressJet to Aventure**
- **Part number 132500-04 appears on Schedule A of the bill of sale**
