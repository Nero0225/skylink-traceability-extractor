User/Installer Responsibilities

It is important to understand that the existence of this document alone does not automatically constitute authority to install the aircraft engine/propeller/article.

Where the user/installer performs work in accordance with the national regulations of an airworthiness authority different than the airworthiness authority of the country specified in Block 1, it is
essential that the user/installer ensures that his/her airworthiness authority accepts aircraft engine(s)/propeller(s)/article(s) from the airworthiness authority of the country specified in Block 1.

Statements in Blocks 13a and 14a do not constitute installation certification. In all cases, aircraft maintenance records must contain an installation certification issued in accordance with the national
regulations by the user/installer before the aircraft may be flown.

FAA Form 8130-3 (02-14)                                                                                       NSN: 0052-00-012-9005

Notes on content and formatting:
1. The letterhead "ATO Aviation Group, LLC" appears at the top of the document.
2. The date is right-aligned.
3. There are some grammatical and spelling errors in the letter, which I've preserved as they appear in the original:
   - "was not been involved" instead of "was not involved" or "has not been involved"
   - "as been in service" instead of "has been in service"
   - "knlowledge" instead of "knowledge"
   - "This as not been obtained" instead of "This has not been obtained"
   - "goverment" instead of "government"
   - "Asurance" instead of "Assurance"
4. The signature is handwritten.
5. The name and title of the signer are left-aligned at the bottom of the letter.
